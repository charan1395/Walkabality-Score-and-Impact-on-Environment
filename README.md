# 🏙️ Walkability Analytics for Sustainable Urban Planning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes city-level features in Nashville to uncover the key drivers of walkability using real-world urban data. The goal is to support sustainable urban planning by identifying strategies that reduce carbon emissions and enhance pedestrian accessibility.

We used clustering and decision tree algorithms to segment regions based on walkability factors like intersection density, land use mix, and transit accessibility. Our findings were translated into actionable planning insights aimed at reducing vehicular emissions and improving urban quality of life.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify high, medium, and low walkability clusters across Nashville.
- Understand which environmental and infrastructural variables impact walkability the most.
- Propose urban design improvements to support climate-friendly mobility and city development.

## 🧠 Approach

### 1. 📥 Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and standardized geographic and infrastructure-related features.
- Applied normalization and dealt with outliers and skewed distributions.

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized walkability patterns across zones.
- Correlation analysis to find relationships between urban variables.

### 3. 📌 Clustering (K-Means)
- Formed 3 distinct walkability clusters (low, moderate, high).
- Used Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters.

### 4. 🌳 Decision Tree Classification
- Trained a decision tree to identify key features differentiating clusters.
- Intersection density, land-use diversity, and public transit access were top contributors.

### 5. 💡 Urban Planning Insights
- Generated recommendations for increasing walkability in low-scoring regions.
- Proposed infrastructure and zoning improvements to boost sustainability.
